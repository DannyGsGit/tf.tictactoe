# Code Files

* *tensorflow_hellow_world.py*: Tensorflow test file to ensure proper installation of the tools.

* *tictactoe_game.py*: A tic tac toe game. Returns a score after each turn where 0 is neutral (i.e. legal, but not game-winning), 1 is a game-winning play, and -1 is an illegal play. Inputing an illegal value (e.g. over an existing piece or outside the board space) results in immediate forfeiture of the game- this decision was made to test the ability of the machine learner to learn the rules of play through experimentation rather than explicit coding (though an input space of 0-8 should be defined in the learner).
